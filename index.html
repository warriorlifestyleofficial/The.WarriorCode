  <h2>Welcome to the Warrior Code</h2>
  <p>
    Warrior Lifestyle is more than apparel — it’s a way of life.  
    Every piece carries a story of discipline, sacrifice, and faith.  
    Built for the gym, the cage, and the street, it reminds us that true strength isn’t just in muscle, but in spirit and in god himself.  
    When you wear Warrior Lifestyle, you wear the fire of resilience and the courage to never quit.  
    This isn’t just clothing. It’s a calling. It’s who we are.

    <h2>Our DNA</h2>
    <p>
      Whether on the streets, in the gym, or in the arena,  
      Warrior Lifestyle stands for resilience, purpose, and identity.  
      This is not fashion. This is a way of life.

  <h2>The Mission</h2>
  <p>
    We were not created to blend in — we were called to stand out.
    Warrior Lifestyle is a movement for those who refuse to quit,
    who fight battles both seen and unseen, and who know that true
    strength comes from faith. Every shirt, every symbol, carries
    the fire of resilience and the spirit of victory.
    <span class="highlight">When you wear Warrior Lifestyle,
    you wear a purpose bigger than yourself.</span>
